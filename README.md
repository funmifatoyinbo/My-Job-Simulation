### Project Overview
As a Data Analyst at Accenture, I just Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client who wants an analysis of the top 5 content category with the largest aggregate popularity in there database.
Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions
Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders
### Data Source
Source: Direct extract from Amplitude, it contained 7 dataset and a data modal sent by the company.
### Tools
- excel- Data cleaning, Modeling, and Analysing
- SQL Server- use to extract the data from the source
- Powerpoint- Use for project presentation
### Data preperation
In the data cleaning,i performed the following tasks.
1. removing rows that have values which are missing.
2. changing the data type of some values within a column.
3. removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
### Expository Data Analysis 
EDA Invovlved  in exploring social media content to get the top 5 content category,
   - What types of content do users post?
   - What category do they fall into?
   - What are their reactions and reaction types?
   - To determine,you need to calculate the total score of their reactions.
    
 ### Data Analysis
 Using excel for this analysis to determine the top 5, i use the SUMIF function to calculate the aggregate total score of each reaction type to every content posted, after merging my different tables using the Vlookup funtion,removng all duplicates and using my filter function in an ascending order.
 ### Findings
 - Having a one table clean spreadsheet
 - Having a total aggregate score of users reactions to content category
 - Having our top 5 content category in view
 - The first on our top 5 got the highest score
 ### Recommendations
 - Company should understand that if top 5,4, and 3 get  thesame engagement as top 1 and 2 it will increase profit
 - company should work with brands associated with top 5,4,and 3 for quality engagement
 - company should also invest in campaigns and promotions after festive season of each year, as analysis shows they got their highest engagement after the festive season.
